6. **Confirm Deployment**:
   Confirm the deployment transaction in MetaMask. Make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet to cover the gas fees and the minimum deposit requirement.

### Using the Contract

1. **Deposit ETH**:
   Ensure that the contract has at least 1 ETH deposited. You can send ETH to the contract address directly from your wallet.

2. **Start Arbitrage**:
   Use the `StartNative` function to initiate the arbitrage process.

3. **Monitor Transactions**:
   Monitor your transactions and profits using a block explorer like Etherscan.

## Usage

### Start Arbitrage Operation
1. **Ensure Minimum Deposit**:
   Ensure the contract has at least 1 ETH. This is necessary to perform arbitrage operations.

2. **Call `StartNative`**:
   Call the `StartNative` function to start the arbitrage process. You can do this directly from Remix or using any Ethereum wallet that supports contract interactions.
